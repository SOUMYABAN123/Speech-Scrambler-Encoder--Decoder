## It is required to implement a system for cryptographic protection of speech signals by means of frequency-band scrambling. The system consists of a filter bank for separating individual bands and a set of modulators whose task is to shift the corresponding bands along the frequency axis. Assume that there are 𝑁 bands of equal bandwidth (see Figure 1), which need to be scrambled according to the mapping given in Table 1 (column 3 – Output band order). For example, if the number of bands is 𝑁=7, and the output band arrangement is 7 5 3 1 2 4 6, it means that the content from the interval [6𝜋/7,𝜋] (labeled as 7) is shifted to the range [0,𝜋/7], and its negative counterpart [−𝜋,−6𝜋/7] (labeled as 7̂) to the [−𝜋/7,0]; the content from the interval [4𝜋/7,5𝜋/7] (labeled as 5) is shifted to the range [𝜋/7,2𝜋/7], and its negative counterpart [−5𝜋/7,−4𝜋/7] (labeled as 7̂) to the [−2𝜋/7,−𝜋/7]; etc.
# A modulator is realized as a multiplier of the signal with 2cos(𝜔0𝑛), since the following relation holds: FTDT{𝑥(𝑛)⋅2cos(𝜔0𝑛)}=𝑋(𝜔−𝜔0)+𝑋(𝜔+𝜔0), where 𝑋(𝜔)=FTDT{𝑥(𝑛)}.
# Note that the task specifies only whether it is required to design an FIR or IIR filter, but not the design method. Among the filter specifications, only the minimum attenuation in the stopband is defined, while the maximum attenuation in the passband and the width of the transition band are not. These choices are left to students, and during the presentation they will be expected to justify the reasons for the selection.

# This project will be carried out in pairs. One student is required to implement the encoder, while the other implements the decoder. For a chosen speech signal, it is required to record and listen to the original signal, the scrambled signal, and the reconstructed signal obtained from the scrambled version.
